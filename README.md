Grocery App

Grocery shopping receipt scanner that can convert receipts into text. Allows users to classify items (it should look up repeatedly bought items so user does not have to classify them each time they are bought) into categories. Users should be able to specify categories that they want to keep track of, and a number of different options would be possible (e.g., running total, average weekly/monthly spend per category, frequently purchased items, etc.), along with other features that could be useful. App should support different shops, and recognise the shop from the name and address on the receipt.
